            <p style={{color:'coral'}}>I am a B.A graduate from Dr. BR Ambedkar Open University, Hyderabad and began my professional journey as a Computer Operator at Cyberworld Internet Cafe in my hometown. My adept browsing skills enabled me to thrive in this role for eight years, where I interacted with diverse customers. Subsequently, I transitioned to a position as a data entry operator at Parikar Solutions Private Limited in Tirupati for one year. Eager to expand my skills, I pursued a six-month Full Stack Development course, excelling particularly in web development. Currently, I am actively seeking employment opportunities in the field of web development.</p>
